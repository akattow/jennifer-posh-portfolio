## Nice to meet you!

There are a lot of roles I can claim: digital marketer, copywriter, community manager, content strategist, editorial director. But at the end of the day, I’m all about storytelling and finding creative ways to express that story.

My training is in creative writing, and since graduating magna cum laude from Beloit College, I’ve dipped my toes in marketing everything from intellectual property law to funeral services. My current full-time home is as **content manager** at VISIT Milwaukee, sharing the city’s story through web content, print pieces, social media, and more.

When I’m not writing for work, I moonlight as a fiction writer and lifestyle blogger. In the rare hours of the day that I’m not writing, I enjoy patronizing local theater, trying new cocktails, and sifting through kitschy treasures in thrift stores.

Feel free to reach out to me at jenniferposh (at) gmail dot com if you’re interested in working on a project together!
